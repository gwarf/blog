## Hey!

This place is mainly a way for me to remember and save some little technical
tips, nothing crazy and not much activity.

## Showing up some badges

Sometimes I like to spend times on gamified learning platforms, below are some
badges for those platforms, being weak to collecting and open to challenges it
works quite well on me.

### TryHackMe
